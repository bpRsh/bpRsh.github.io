# Athens, Ohio (Snowfall)
In Athens, Ohio, on February 9th,
The snow falls softly, gently down,
Covering the streets and buildings with a white,
Blanket of winter's frozen crown.

The air is crisp, the sky is clear,
As the snowflakes dance and twirl,
Filling the town with a magical glow,
And a sense of peace and quiet pearl.

Children laugh and play outside,
Throwing snowballs and making snowmen,
Their joy and laughter filling the air,
As they revel in the beauty of the snow again.

The trees are laden with a white,
Blanket of snow, their branches bent,
Bowing to the winter's might,
As the snow continues to be sent.

In Athens, Ohio, on February 9th,
The snow falls softly, gently down,
Filling the town with a magical,
Beauty that cannot be found.
