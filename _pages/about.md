I am a PhD student at the Ohio University working in galaxy cluster simulation under
[Douglas Clowe](https://www.ohio.edu/cas/physastro/faculty/profiles.cfm?profile=clowe).


## Professional
I am also a member in the [Dark Energy Science Collaboration](http://www.lsst-desc.org/) (DESC) where I actively participate in the clusters working group. Within DESC, I am working on a cluster simulation pipeline so called "Jedisim" to study
the effects of wavelength dependent PSF on the shear and mass of the observed galaxy clusters.
The program was originally developed by Dan Parker (Brown University in about year 2013).
The software takes in the galaxy images from telescope survery such as HST, CANDELS and
using various physics parameters simulates the images that will look like LSST images.
