I am currently working as a Data Scientist at
[AmerisourceBergen](https://www.amerisourcebergen.com).


## Research
During my PhD in Astrophysics from Ohio University as [Dark Energy Science Collaboration](http://www.lsst-desc.org/) (DESC) member I actively participate in the Galaxy Cluster working group. Within DESC, I worked on a cluster simulation pipeline called "Jedisim" to study
the effects of wavelength dependent PSF on the shear and mass of the observed galaxy clusters.

The software takes in the galaxy images from telescope survery such as HST, CANDELS and
using various physics parameters simulates the images that will look like taken from LSST images.
