I am currently working as a Data Scientist at
[AmerisourceBergen](https://www.amerisourcebergen.com). I have worked in multiple units inside the company. At GPO unit of AB (AmerisourceBergen), I worked on projects such as time series projections for sales of medical products. I utilized state-of-the-art algorithm and made multiple enhancements to improve the existing model by 20%. The model highly accurately predicts the sales amount at Quarterly frequency.

I also worked on string matching (fuzzy matching) and improved both the accuracy and the efficiency of model. I improved the run time of the algorithm from 4 hours to few minutes.

I also worked on Anomaly Detection and studied the anaomalous sale transactions so that we can notifiy the account managers and take actions in timely manner.

Besides these projects, I worked on many small projects understaing the existing sales databases
and creating mutlitude of reports using PowerBI.


## Research
During my PhD in Astrophysics from Ohio University as [Dark Energy Science Collaboration](http://www.lsst-desc.org/) (DESC) member I actively participate in the Galaxy Cluster working group. Within DESC, I worked on a cluster simulation pipeline called "Jedisim" to study
the effects of wavelength dependent PSF on the shear and mass of the observed galaxy clusters.

The software takes in the galaxy images from telescope survery such as HST, CANDELS and
using various physics parameters simulates the images that will look like taken from LSST images.
